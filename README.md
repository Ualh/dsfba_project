# Analyzing the Impact of External Factors on the Adoption of Electric Vehicles in Switzerland (2005-2022)

## Background and Motivation
With climatic challenges emerging as pivotal concerns of our times, understanding the dynamics driving environmentally conscious consumer behaviors is paramount. Our team's keen interest in environmental sustainability and the transition to electric vehicles in Switzerland spurs this research. This dedication to deciphering the nuances of eco-friendly consumption patterns is the driving force behind our topic selection.

## Project Objectives
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand how environmental consciousness, as depicted by Google Trends, correlates with EV adoption in Switzerland.
- **Causal Inference**: Examine the direct impact of oil prices, demographic shifts, and major policy or automotive industry trends on EV adoption.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Predict future EV adoption trends based on historical data and align them with major external events or policy introductions.
- **Regional Analysis**: Identify Swiss regions with high or low EV adoption and correlate these patterns with external factors.
- **Policy & Industry Impact Analysis**: Understand how significant policy changes, global environmental events, and automotive industry trends have influenced EV adoption.

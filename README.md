# Energizing Change: Electric Vehicle Rise in Switzerland
This study explores electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in Switzerland, investigating factors like regional differences, demographic influences, and comparisons with France. It uses diverse datasets, including vehicle registrations, oil prices, demographics, Google trends, and political affiliations. Key findings include a rise in EV registrations, variations in adoption rates across regions and demographics, and the influence of charging station availability. The analysis also highlights the role of political dynamics in EV adoption. Limitations include the lack of detailed pricing data and the unexplored impact of marketing and government subsidies. Future research could delve into these aspects for a more nuanced understanding.

## Background and Motivation
With climatic challenges emerging as pivotal concerns of our times, understanding the dynamics driving environmentally conscious consumer behaviors is paramount. Our team's keen interest in environmental sustainability and the transition to electric vehicles in Switzerland spurs this research. This dedication to deciphering the nuances of eco-friendly consumption patterns is the driving force behind our topic selection.

### Reseach Questions

-   

    1.  Based on past electric vehicle adoption trends in Switzerland,
        can we forecast future adoption rates and pinpoint times of
        significant increases or decreases correlated with major events
        or policy changes?

-   

    2.  Are there differences in adoption rate within the different
        regions in Switzerland? And are there different buying behaviors
        displayed by the demographic segments within Switzerland ?

-   

    3.  How has the growth of electric vehicles evolved in comparison to
        other countries such as France, and what factors might account
        for the differences in their evolution ?

-   

    4.  To what extent does the evolution in the availability of
        charging stations exert an influence on the adoption of electric
        vehicles in Switzerland?

### Simple Linear Regression

#### With Oil

Choosing Dependent Variable, sales or EV registrations

Sales Data (from `df_sales_EV`):

Pros: Directly reflects market demand and consumer purchasing behavior.
Cons: Can be influenced by short-term factors such as promotions or
subsidies, which might not indicate long-term adoption trends.

Registration Data (from `df_v_electric`):

Pros: Represents actual additions to the vehicle population and can be
more indicative of long-term trends in EV adoption. Cons: Might lag
behind sales data, as registration occurs post-purchase and can be
influenced by administrative processes.

interested in long-term trends in EV adoption and usage, registration
data could be more appropriate.

The decision to remove rows with missing values was justified as the
number of missing values in the Price column was relatively small (28
out of a larger dataset) and couldn't be reliably imputed, ensuring that
the analysis was performed on a more complete and consistent dataset.

```{r}
str(df_v_electric)
str(df_oil)
```

```{r}
# Select the columns you want to keep in df_v_electric
df_v_electric <- df_v_electric %>%
  select(Location, Count, Date)

# Merge df_oil_monthly with df_v_electric based on the common 'Date' column
df_merged <- merge(df_v_electric, df_oil_monthly, by = "Date", all.x = TRUE)

# Remove rows with missing values in the 'Price' column
df_merged <- df_merged[complete.cases(df_merged), ]

# View the first few rows of the merged dataset
head(df_merged)
# Check for missing values in df_merged
sum(is.na(df_merged))
# Check for missing values in each column of df_merged
colSums(is.na(df_merged))
```

```{r}
# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
split_index <- sample(1:nrow(df_merged), 0.8 * nrow(df_merged))
train_data <- df_merged[split_index, ]
test_data <- df_merged[-split_index, ]

# Fitting the linear model
model <- lm(Count ~ Price, data = train_data)

# Summary of the model to view coefficients and statistics
summary(model)

# Predicting with the test data
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)

# Evaluating the model
# Calculating R-squared value
r_squared <- cor(test_data$Count, predictions)^2
cat("R-squared: ", r_squared, "\n")

# Calculating RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - test_data$Count)^2))
cat("RMSE: ", rmse, "\n")
```

The linear regression analysis results indicate that the Price variable
has a very weak or negligible effect on explaining the variation in the
Count variable. Specifically:

The coefficient for Price is very close to zero (-0.00542), indicating
that there is almost no linear relationship between Price and Count.

The p-value for Price (0.97) is much greater than the common
significance level of 0.05. This high p-value suggests that Price is not
statistically significant in predicting Count, as it fails to reject the
null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero.

The R-squared value is very low (0.000523), indicating that the linear
regression model explains only a negligible fraction of the variance in
Count.

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is relatively high (247), suggesting
that the model's predictions have a substantial amount of error.

In summary, based on these results, it appears that the Price variable
does not have a meaningful impact on predicting the Count variable, and
the linear regression model is not suitable for explaining the
relationship between these two variables. Further exploration of the
data and potentially considering other factors or modeling approaches
may be necessary to improve predictive accuracy.

#### with google trends

```{r}
# Merge the two datasets based on the common Date column
df_merged <- merge(df_merged, df_gtrends, by = "Date")

# View the first few rows of the merged dataset
head(df_merged)
# Check for missing values in df_merged
sum(is.na(df_merged))
# Check for missing values in each column of df_merged
colSums(is.na(df_merged))
```

```{r}
# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
split_index <- sample(1:nrow(df_merged), 0.8 * nrow(df_merged))
train_data <- df_merged[split_index, ]
test_data <- df_merged[-split_index, ]

# Fitting the linear model
model <- lm(Count ~ SearchRatio, data = train_data)

# Summary of the model to view coefficients and statistics
summary(model)

# Predicting with the test data
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)

# Evaluating the model
# Calculating R-squared value
r_squared <- cor(test_data$Count, predictions)^2
cat("R-squared: ", r_squared, "\n")

# Calculating RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - test_data$Count)^2))
cat("RMSE: ", rmse, "\n")
```

Overall, while there is a statistically significant relationship between
SearchRatio and Count, the model's R-squared value suggests that other
factors not included in the model may also influence the Count variable.
You may want to explore additional variables or more complex models to
improve predictive accuracy.

### Multivariable Regression
#### with Demographic groups, Oil Price and Google Trend

```{r}
# Merge the data frames on the 'Year' column
df_merged <- merge(df_merged, df_demographic, by.x = "Date", by.y = "Year")

# Check the merged data
head(df_merged)  # Display the first few rows to verify the merge

```
```{r}
# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
split_index <- sample(1:nrow(df_merged), 0.8 * nrow(df_merged))
train_data <- df_merged[split_index, ]
test_data <- df_merged[-split_index, ]

# Fitting the multivariable linear model
model <- lm(Count ~ SearchRatio + Price + `Generation Z` + Millennials + `Generation X` + `Baby Boomers`, data = df_merged)

# Summary of the model to view coefficients and statistics
summary(model)

# Predicting with the test data (if applicable)
# Replace test_data with your test dataset if you have one
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)

# Evaluating the model
# Calculating R-squared value
r_squared <- cor(test_data$Count, predictions)^2
cat("R-squared: ", r_squared, "\n")

# Calculating RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - test_data$Count)^2))
cat("RMSE: ", rmse, "\n")

```
This multivariate linear regression model does not appear to have a strong explanatory power, as indicated by the low adjusted R-squared value and the relatively high RMSE. Additionally, only the Baby Boomers variable shows statistical significance in predicting the Count, while other variables do not appear to be significant in this context. You may want to consider further refining the model or exploring other variables to improve its predictive performance.

#### Adding Political Parties
```{r}
df_merged
```

```{r}
unique(df_merged$Location)
unique(political_combined_data$Canton)
str(political_combined_data)
political_combined_data
```
Exclude 'Confederation' from the first dataset (df_merged).
```{r}
# Remove 'Confederation' from df_merged
df_merged <- df_merged[df_merged$Location != 'Confederation', ]
df_merged
```

Create a 'Switzerland' Observation in the second dataset (df_politic_ch.csv):
For each year, sum the values of the 26 cantons to create a combined observation labeled "Switzerland".
```{r}
# Step 2: Aggregate data for 'Switzerland' in df2
political_combined_data$Year <- year(ymd(political_combined_data$Year))
df_politics <- political_combined_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(across(c(`Against`, `Slightly Against`, `Neutral`, `Slightly in Favour`, `In Favour`), sum, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(Canton = 'Switzerland')
df_politics
# Append the new 'Switzerland' rows to df_politics
df_politics <- bind_rows(political_combined_data, df_politics)
df_politics
```

Align and Format the Date Columns:
Convert the 'Date' column in the first dataset to just the year to match the 'Year' column in the second dataset.
```{r}
# Step 3: Align 'Date' in df_merged to 'Year' in df_politics
df_merged$Year <- year(ymd(df_merged$Date))
df_merged <- select(df_merged, -Date)
df_merged
```

Merge the Datasets:
Merge the datasets on the aligned 'Location/Canton' and 'Date/Year' columns.
```{r}
df_politics$Location <- df_politics$Canton 
# Step 4: Merge the datasets on 'Canton' and 'Year'
merged_df <- merge(df_merged, df_politics, by = c("Location", "Year"), all = FALSE)

# View the first few rows of the merged dataset
head(merged_df)
merged_df

# Reorder columns in a data frame
merged_df <- merged_df %>%
  select(Count, everything())

merged_df
```

```{r}
merged_df <- na.omit(merged_df)

# Perform regression analysis without 'Location'
full_model <- lm(Count ~ Year + Price + SearchRatio + `Generation Z` + Millennials + `Generation X` + `Baby Boomers` + Against + `Slightly Against` + Neutral + `Slightly in Favour` + `In Favour`, data = merged_df)

# Perform backward elimination
reduced_model <- step(full_model, direction = "backward")

# View the summary of the reduced model
summary(reduced_model)


# Perform backward elimination
reduced_model <- step(full_model, direction = "backward")

# View the summary of the reduced model
summary(reduced_model)

```
The final model resulting from the backward elimination process for predicting 'Count' (presumably EV registrations) includes two predictors: 'SearchRatio' and 'In Favour'. Let's interpret the model's output:

1. **Coefficients**:
   - **Intercept (-13.5135)**: This is the expected value of 'Count' when both 'SearchRatio' and 'In Favour' are zero. The negative intercept suggests that, in the absence of these predictors, the model predicts a negative count, which might not be meaningful in your context. It indicates that the model might not be fully capturing the underlying relationship at lower levels of these variables.
   - **SearchRatio (0.8080)**: For each unit increase in 'SearchRatio', the 'Count' is expected to increase by approximately 0.8080 units, holding all else constant. This positive coefficient suggests a direct relationship between 'SearchRatio' and EV registrations.
   - **In Favour (0.2369)**: For each unit increase in 'In Favour', the 'Count' is expected to increase by approximately 0.2369 units, holding all else constant. This implies that more favorable opinions (as captured by the 'In Favour' variable) are associated with higher EV registrations.

2. **Statistical Significance**:
   - All coefficients are statistically significant at the 0.05 level (as indicated by the asterisks and low p-values). This means there is a statistically significant relationship between 'SearchRatio', 'In Favour', and EV registrations.

3. **Model Fit**:
   - **Multiple R-squared (0.317)**: This value indicates that about 31.7% of the variability in 'Count' is explained by the model. While this is a moderate amount, it suggests that other factors not included in the model also play a significant role in explaining EV registrations.
   - **Adjusted R-squared (0.303)**: This is a more accurate measure of model fit as it adjusts for the number of predictors. It suggests that after adjustment, about 30.3% of the variability in 'Count' is explained by the model.
   - **F-statistic (23.4)**: This value, along with the very low p-value (4.35e-09), indicates that the model is statistically significant. This means that the model provides a better fit to the data than a model with no predictors.

4. **Residuals**:
   - The residuals have a range from -18.76 to 56.08, with the median closer to zero. However, the spread of residuals and the presence of relatively large maximum values suggest there might be outliers or that the relationship might not be perfectly linear.

In summary, the model indicates that both 'SearchRatio' and 'In Favour' are significant predictors of EV registrations, with a positive association. However, the moderate R-squared value suggests that there are other factors affecting EV registrations that are not captured by this model. Additionally, the data might benefit from further exploration, such as investigating potential outliers or nonlinear relationships.


## 4.3 RQ3

In comparing regions in Switzerland, which areas show higher or lower
adoption of electric vehicles, and how does this regional adoption align
or vary with external factors like oil price changes, political
opinions, and demographic shifts?

```{r}
df_demographic
df_v_electric
```

From the initial data:

In 2005, the EV adoption rate per capita was approximately 0.000004,
which means there were about 4 EVs per million people. By 2009, this
rate increased to approximately 18 EVs per million people.

This approach will give us a general sense of EV adoption in relation to
the overall population but won't provide regional demographic
granularity.

The merged data now includes the total population for each year in
Switzerland and the total count of electric vehicles (EVs) for those
years. We have also calculated the EV adoption rate per capita, which
gives us an insight into how EV adoption scales with the population
size.

These figures show a growing trend in EV adoption in relation to the
population size, albeit the numbers are still quite small relative to
the total population.

The trend shows a gradual increase in EV adoption relative to the
population size, indicating a growing acceptance and usage of electric
vehicles in Switzerland during this period.

```{r}
# Extract year from the Date columns in both datasets
df_demographic <- df_demographic %>% mutate(Year_Extracted = year(as.Date(Year)))
df_v_electric <- df_v_electric %>% mutate(Year_Extracted = year(as.Date(Date)))

# Aggregate EV counts in df_v_electric by extracted year
ev_count_per_year <- df_v_electric %>%
  group_by(Year_Extracted) %>%
  summarize(Total_EV_Count = sum(Count))

# Merge datasets and calculate EV adoption rate per capita
merged_data <- merge(df_demographic, ev_count_per_year, by = "Year_Extracted")
merged_data$EV_Adoption_Rate_Per_Capita <- merged_data$Total_EV_Count / merged_data$Total_Population

# Creating an interactive plot
p <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Year_Extracted, y = EV_Adoption_Rate_Per_Capita)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "EV Adoption Rate Per Capita in Switzerland",
       x = "Year",
       y = "EV Adoption Rate Per Capita")

# Convert to interactive plot and adjust legend
ggplotly(p, width = 600, height = 400) %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = 'h', x = 0.5, xanchor = 'center', y = -0.15))

```

The correlation matrix below shows the relationships between the
proportions of different generational groups (Generation Z, Millennials,
Generation X, Baby Boomers) and the EV adoption rate per capita in
Switzerland. The heatmap provides the following insights:

The correlation coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the
relationship between each pair of variables. Positive values suggest a
positive correlation (as one increases, so does the other), while
negative values suggest an inverse relationship.

```{r}
# Calculate proportions of each generation
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(
    Generation_Z_Prop = `Generation Z` / Total_Population,
    Millennials_Prop = Millennials / Total_Population,
    Generation_X_Prop = `Generation X` / Total_Population,
    Baby_Boomers_Prop = `Baby Boomers` / Total_Population
  )

# Selecting relevant columns for correlation
correlation_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(Generation_Z_Prop, Millennials_Prop, Generation_X_Prop, Baby_Boomers_Prop, EV_Adoption_Rate_Per_Capita)

# Clean up the column names for a prettier output

## 4.4 RQç

## 4.5 RQ5
To what extent does the evolution in the availability of charging stations exert an influence on the adoption of electric vehicles in Switzerland?
```{r}
# First, let's merge the df_v and df_charge_number_CH data sets, and we will look at Fuel: Electricity

df_v_electric_total_ch <- df_v %>%
  filter(Fuel == "Electricity", VehicleType == "Passenger car", Location == c("Switzerland","Confederation")) %>%
  select(Date, Count)

sum_by_year <- df_v_electric_total_ch %>%
  group_by(Year = lubridate::year(Date)) %>%
  summarise(Total_Count = sum(Count))


# Convert year to a common format for merging
sum_by_year <- sum_by_year %>%
  mutate(year = as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")))

# Merge the datasets based on the "year" column
merged_v_charge <- left_join(sum_by_year, df_charge_number_CH, by = c("year" = "year"))

# cleaning merged data set
merged_v_charge <- merged_v_charge %>%
  filter(Year > "2011") %>%
  select(Year, Total_Count, powertrain, value)

names(merged_v_charge)[names(merged_v_charge) == "Total_count"] <- "EVs"
colnames(merged_v_charge)[colnames(merged_v_charge) == "value"] <- "Charging station"

# Summing Powertrain together
merged_v_charge <- merged_v_charge %>%
  group_by(Year, Total_Count) %>%
  summarise(Count = sum(`Charging station`))

# Checking the correlation
corr_charge_ev <- cor(merged_v_charge$Total_Count, merged_v_charge$Count)

# their correlation is 0.957, almost perfectly correlated (no suprise here)

# Checking for lagged correlation

lags_to_explore <- 1:3

lagged_correlation <- function(data, lag) {
  data %>%
    mutate(Count_Lagged = lag(Count, n = lag, default = NA)) %>%
    summarise(Correlation = cor(Total_Count, Count_Lagged, use = "complete.obs"))
}

# Calculate lagged correlations for each lag
lagged_correlations_df <- data.frame(Lag = lags_to_explore) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(Correlation = lagged_correlation(merged_v_charge[, -1], Lag)$Correlation)

# Print the results
print("Original Correlation:")
print(corr_charge_ev)

print("Lagged Correlations:")
print(lagged_correlations_df)


# Now we formulate the following Hypothesis

# H0: new charging station increase EV adoption vs. H1: new charging station does not increase EV adoption

# Check these hypotheses with a simple linear regression
linear_charging <- lm(Total_Count ~ Count, data = merged_v_charge)

# Poisson Test
poisson_model <- glm(Total_Count ~ Count, family = poisson, data = merged_v_charge)

# Set up the layout using mfrow
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # 1 row, 2 columns

# Plotting for Simple Linear Regression
plot(linear, 1, main = "LM Residuals vs Fitted")

# Plotting for Poisson Regression

# Reset the layout
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```
The year-on-year correlation is the highest, the lagged correlation diminishes. We could suggest hat the availability of charging stations and the new registration of EVs go hand-in-hand, and that the availability of new charging station does not create a demand of new EVs by itself. Correlation does not imply causation, while we see a relationship, we can't conclude that charging stations directly cause changes in electric vehicle adoption only with a Correlation analysis

With both a linear regression and a Poisson-test. We find evidence of statistically significant relationship between the count of available charging station and the count of electric vehicles registered. We have Prediction variable/coefficient of 2.68 x 10^-4 and 3.34 respectively. And a p-val < 0.005 for both. However, it is important to remind ourselves that these variables have a bidirectional / mutual influence, beyond the scope of what our analysis shows. The relationship is not strictly unidirectional and therefore, it is hard to conclude anything without further domain-knowledge and context-specific information

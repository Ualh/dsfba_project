## 1.1 Background and Motivation

In an era marked by unprecedented environmental challenges, our world is
at a critical juncture where sustainable practices are no longer an
option but a necessity. Climate change, driven by anthropogenic
activities, poses an imminent threat to the delicate ecological balance.
Recognizing the urgency of this global issue, we are compelled to
investigate the specific context of Switzerland, the country we live in,
and which has a lot of financial capacities to change rapidly.

The automotive sector plays a pivotal role in shaping the a sustainable
world, and our focus on electric vehicle adoption in Switzerland
reflects a strategic choice to comprehend the intricate interplay of
factors driving this transition.

The motivations underlying our research stem from a multifaceted
perspective. Firstly, the automotive industry is undergoing a
transformative shift globally, with electric vehicles emerging as a key
solution to reduce carbon emissions. By narrowing our focus to
Switzerland, we aim to provide nuanced insights into the factors
influencing EV adoption, offering a unique perspective on the
socio-economic, environmentally stable and financially comfortable Swiss
context. The adoption of electric vehicles provides an insight into
people's inclination to make efforts towards sustainability. This
emphasizes the crucial role that electric vehicle adoption plays in
evaluating society's commitment to sustainable practices.

Secondly, our commitment to environmental sustainability extends beyond
a generic interest. The urgency of addressing climate change has never
been more palpable, and our research seeks to contribute to the
discussion on sustainable mobility.

Moreover, we believe the future is encapsulated in our dedication to
understanding the dynamics of environmentally conscious consumer
behavior. By unraveling the complexities of EV adoption in Switzerland
over the years (2005-2022), we aim to offer valuable insights that could
guide policymakers, businesses, and consumers towards more informed and
sustainable choices.

We believe that by comprehensively analyzing the impact of external
factors on the adoption of electric vehicles in Switzerland, we can
contribute meaningfully to the ongoing global efforts towards a more
sustainable and resilient future. Through this project, we aspire to
inspire positive change, foster innovation, and advocate for a paradigm
shift towards eco-friendly practices in the automotive sector and
beyond.

## 1.3 Reseach Questions

-   

    1.  Based on past electric vehicle adoption trends in Switzerland,
        can we forecast future adoption rates and pinpoint times of
        significant increases or decreases correlated with major events
        or policy changes?

-   

    2.  In comparing regions in Switzerland, which areas show higher or
        lower adoption of electric vehicles, and how does this regional
        adoption align or vary with external factors like oil price
        changes, political opinions, and demographic shifts?

-   

    3.  How has the growth of electric vehicles evolved in comparison to
        other countries such as France, and what factors might account
        for the differences in their evolution ?

-   

    4.  To what extent does the evolution in the availability of
        charging stations exert an influence on the adoption of electric
        vehicles in Switzerland?

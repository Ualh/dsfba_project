## Background and Motivation

Climatic challenges have emerged as some of the most pressing concerns of our era. As we grapple with these issues, it becomes crucial to understand the dynamics behind environmentally conscious consumer behaviors, especially in sectors that significantly contribute to carbon emissions, such as transportation. 

Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable alternative to traditional combustion engine vehicles. Switzerland, with its commitment to environmental sustainability, has seen a notable shift towards EV adoption. This project arises from our team's profound interest in understanding this shift and the external factors influencing it. By deciphering the nuances of eco-friendly consumption patterns, especially in the context of EVs, we aim to provide insights that can guide policy-making, industry shifts, and consumer awareness campaigns.

## Reseach Questions

- 1. How does the rise in environmental consciousness, as depicted by Google Trends, correlate with electric vehicle adoption in Switzerland across different regions and over time, especially in relation to oil price fluctuations and demographic changes?
- 2. Given fluctuations in oil prices, demographic shifts, and major policy or automotive industry trends, which of these factors have a direct causal impact on the shifts in the adoption of electric vehicles in Switzerland?
- 3. Based on past electric vehicle adoption trends in Switzerland, can we forecast future adoption rates and pinpoint times of significant increases or decreases correlated with major events or policy changes?
- 4. In comparing regions in Switzerland, which areas show higher or lower adoption of electric vehicles, and how does this regional adoption align or vary with external factors like oil price changes, environmental consciousness, and demographic shifts?
- 5. To what extent have policy alterations, global environmental incidents, and shifts in the automotive industry affected electric vehicle adoption in Switzerland?
